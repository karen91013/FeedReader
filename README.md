# FeedReader
## General overview:

Testing a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## In-Depth Explanation:

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Working in a test-driven development assures us that future feature development doesn't break existing features and is an important skill to have.

This project helped me learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These tests will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.<br>
